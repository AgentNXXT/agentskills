name: website-policy-drafting-skill
description: >
  Drafts legal and compliance policy documents for digital products including websites, SaaS
  platforms, AI systems, APIs, mobile apps, and marketplaces. Designed for founders, developers,
  and product/compliance teams at any stage. Use this skill whenever anyone asks about privacy
  policies, terms of service, cookie policies, GDPR, CCPA, AI usage policies, responsible AI,
  data processing agreements, acceptable use policies, API usage policies, community guidelines,
  accessibility policies, or any compliance/governance documentation. Trigger this skill even if
  the user only mentions a regulation (e.g. "do I need GDPR compliance?"), a policy type
  ("write me a ToS"), describes their product and implies they need documentation ("I'm building
  an AI SaaS"), or asks compliance questions as a developer or product manager. Always use this
  skill for policy drafting, compliance roadmaps, and governance document creation for digital
  products — regardless of whether the user is a technical or non-technical role.

## Mode Detection — Choose the Right Flow

**Before doing anything else:**
1. Check if memory contains an `[Autonomyx Policy Agent]` entry for this user
2. If yes → greet them with their product context and compliance dashboard (see Memory section)
3. If no → proceed with mode detection below

**Then determine which mode to use:**

### 🚀 One-Prompt Generation Mode (auto-detect)

Trigger this mode when the user's opening message already contains enough product context to infer
what they're building — even if they didn't explicitly ask for a specific policy. Signals include:

- Mentions a product type (SaaS, app, marketplace, API, platform)
- Mentions integrations or tools (Stripe, OpenAI, Google Analytics, Firebase, etc.)
- Mentions a tech stack, user base, or geographic market
- Uses phrases like "I'm building...", "we have...", "our product...", "generate all policies for..."

**When One-Prompt Mode triggers, run this sequence automatically without asking questions:**

1. **Extract** product characteristics from the message:
   - Product type & description
   - AI usage (tools, providers, features)
   - Payment processing
   - Analytics & tracking
   - Authentication method
   - Third-party integrations
   - Data collected
   - Geographic user base

2. **State your inferences** clearly before proceeding:
   > "Here's what I've inferred about your product: [bulleted summary]. I'll use this to generate
   > your compliance analysis. Let me know if anything needs correcting."

3. **Run compliance analysis** — identify applicable regulations (GDPR, CCPA, DPDP, EU AI Act)
   and explain why each applies.

4. **Generate a prioritised policy roadmap:**

   ```
   🗺️ Compliance Roadmap for [Product Name]

   Priority 1 — Required immediately:
   • [Policy] — reason

   Priority 2 — Recommended before launch:
   • [Policy] — reason

   Priority 3 — As you scale:
   • [Policy] — reason
   ```

5. **Draft the highest-priority policy immediately** (usually Privacy Policy or ToS), then ask:
   > "I've drafted your [Policy]. Would you like me to continue with the next priority policy,
   > adjust this one, or export it?"

6. **After each policy**, show the Compliance Dashboard and offer to continue to the next.

---

### 🗺️ Compliance Roadmap Mode

Use this mode when:
- The user asks "what policies do I need?", "where do I start?", "give me a compliance roadmap"
- The user describes their product and wants a plan rather than a single policy
- One-Prompt Mode has run and the user wants to see the full roadmap before drafting

See **Compliance Roadmap Generator** section for the full workflow.

### 🔍 Policy Review Mode

Use this mode when:
- The user pastes an existing policy and asks for feedback
- The user says "review", "check", "audit", "improve", or "is this compliant"
- The user uploads a policy document

See **Policy Review & Improvement Mode** section for the full workflow.

### 💬 Interactive Mode (step-by-step)

Use this mode when:
- The user asks for a specific policy without product context ("write me a privacy policy")
- The user explicitly asks to be guided through the process
- There isn't enough context to infer product details confidently

---

## Core Workflow (Interactive Mode)

### Step 1 — Identify the Policy

Ask the user which policy they want to create (or detect it from context). If unclear, offer the
list above and ask them to pick one.

### Step 2 — Gather Product Information (Interactive, One Question at a Time)

Ask these questions **one at a time**, in order. Wait for each answer before proceeding.
Skip questions that are clearly irrelevant to the selected policy type.

**Universal questions (ask for every policy):**
1. What is your product name and a one-sentence description?
2. What type of product is it? (SaaS, mobile app, marketplace, API, website, other)
3. Where are your users based? (e.g. US, EU, India, global)
4. What is your company name and country of incorporation?

**Data & privacy questions (Privacy Policy, DPA, Cookie Policy):**
5. What personal data do you collect? (e.g. name, email, payment info, location, usage data)
6. Do you use any analytics tools? (e.g. Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude)
7. Do you process payments? If so, which provider? (e.g. Stripe, Razorpay, PayPal)
8. Do you use any third-party services that receive user data? (e.g. email providers, CRMs, CDNs)
9. Do you use cookies or tracking pixels?

**AI-specific questions (AI Usage / Responsible AI Policy):**
10. What AI features does your product have? (e.g. chatbot, content generation, recommendations)
11. Which AI providers or models do you use? (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, self-hosted)
12. Does user input get sent to these AI providers?
13. Do AI outputs affect any high-stakes decisions (hiring, credit, health, legal)?

**Platform/community questions (AUP, Marketplace, Community Guidelines):**
14. Can users post content, list items, or interact with each other?
15. What categories of prohibited content or behavior should be covered?

**API questions (API Usage Policy):**
16. Is your API public or restricted to registered developers?
17. Do you have rate limits or usage tiers?

### Step 3 — Detect Applicable Regulations

Based on answers, automatically identify relevant regulations and note them before drafting:

- **GDPR** — if any EU/UK users
- **UK GDPR** — if UK users post-Brexit
- **CCPA/CPRA** — if California/US users and revenue/data thresholds may apply
- **India DPDP Act** — if Indian users
- **EU AI Act** — if AI features and EU users (note risk tier if determinable)
- **WCAG 2.1 / ADA** — if accessibility policy requested

State clearly: *"Based on your answers, the following regulations likely apply: [list]. I'll include
relevant clauses. Note: this is not legal advice — please have a qualified lawyer review before
publication."*

### Step 4 — Draft the Policy

Generate the full policy using the formatting rules below. After drafting, ask:
> "Does this look good? Would you like to adjust any sections, add clauses, or switch to a
> simplified plain-language version?"

### Step 5 — Offer Export Format

Ask: "Would you like this as:
- **Markdown** (for docs, Notion, GitHub, MDX)
- **Formatted plain text** (for copy-paste directly into a website CMS or builder)"

Then output in the chosen format.

## Compliance Roadmap Generator

Trigger this when the user asks for a "compliance roadmap", "what policies do I need", "where do I
start with compliance", or after One-Prompt Mode extracts product context.

### How to generate the roadmap

**Step 1 — Collect context** (if not already known):
Ask in a single message:
> "To build your roadmap I need a few quick details:
> 1. What type of product is it? (SaaS, marketplace, API, mobile app, other)
> 2. What's your user geography? (US, EU, India, global, etc.)
> 3. Do you use AI features, payment processing, or user-generated content?
> 4. Are you pre-launch, recently launched, or scaling?"

**Step 2 — Detect regulations** from the answers (same logic as Core Workflow Step 3).

**Step 3 — Output the roadmap** using this format:

```
🗺️ Compliance Roadmap — [Product Name]
Generated: [Today's date]
Regulations detected: [GDPR / CCPA / DPDP / EU AI Act / etc.]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔴 PRIORITY 1 — Required Before Launch
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Privacy Policy
  Why: You collect personal data from [regions]. Required under [regulations].
  Complexity: Medium | Estimated effort: 1–2 hours with this tool

• Terms of Service
  Why: Defines user rights, liability limits, and acceptable use.
  Complexity: Medium | Estimated effort: 1–2 hours

• Cookie Policy  [if analytics/tracking detected]
  Why: Required under GDPR/ePrivacy if you use cookies or tracking pixels.
  Complexity: Low | Estimated effort: 30 minutes

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🟡 PRIORITY 2 — Recommended Within 30 Days
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Acceptable Use Policy  [if platform/SaaS]
  Why: Protects you from misuse and sets enforcement rights.

• AI Usage / Responsible AI Policy  [if AI features detected]
  Why: Required for EU AI Act transparency obligations; builds user trust.

• API Usage Policy  [if developer API detected]
  Why: Sets legal terms for third-party API consumers.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🟢 PRIORITY 3 — As You Scale
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Data Processing Agreement (DPA)  [if B2B / enterprise customers]
  Why: Required under GDPR when processing data on behalf of business clients.

• Accessibility Policy  [if public-facing product]
  Why: Required under ADA (US) / EN 301 549 (EU) for broader compliance.

• Marketplace / Community Guidelines  [if UGC or marketplace features]
  Why: Defines content rules and enforcement procedures.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚡ Quick Start Recommendation
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Start with: [highest priority policy]
I can draft it for you right now. Just say "yes" or name a different policy to start with.
```

Only include policies that are relevant to the product. Omit irrelevant rows entirely.
After outputting the roadmap, always offer to draft the top-priority policy immediately.

---

## Policy Review & Improvement Mode

Trigger this when the user:
- Pastes an existing policy into the chat
- Says "review my policy", "check my privacy policy", "improve my ToS", "is my policy compliant"
- Uploads a policy document and asks for feedback

### Review Workflow

**Step 1 — Identify the policy type** from the pasted content. If ambiguous, ask.

**Step 2 — Ask one scoping question:**
> "Before I review — which regions are your users in? (e.g. EU, US, India, global)
> This determines which regulations I'll check against."

**Step 3 — Analyse the policy** across these dimensions:

| Dimension | What to check |
|---|---|
| **Completeness** | Are all required sections present for this policy type? |
| **GDPR compliance** | Legal basis, data subject rights, DPO, international transfers, retention |
| **CCPA/CPRA compliance** | Right to know, delete, opt-out, no sale disclosure |
| **DPDP compliance** | Consent notice, data fiduciary obligations, grievance redressal |
| **EU AI Act** | Transparency obligations, human oversight, prohibited practices (if AI policy) |
| **Clarity** | Is the language clear and understandable to an average user? |
| **Missing clauses** | What's absent that should be present? |
| **Outdated content** | References to deprecated regulations, old dates, stale third-party names |

**Step 4 — Output the review report** using this format:

```
📋 Policy Review Report — [Policy Type]
Reviewed: [Today's date]
Regulations checked: [list]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Overall Score: [X/10]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ STRENGTHS
• [What the policy does well — be specific]
• ...

⚠️ ISSUES FOUND
• [Issue 1] — Severity: High / Medium / Low
  Missing / Incomplete / Outdated
  Recommendation: [specific fix]

• [Issue 2] — Severity: ...
  Recommendation: ...

🔴 CRITICAL GAPS  (only if any exist)
• [Clause or section entirely missing that is legally required]
  Required by: [regulation]
  Action: Add a section on [topic]

💡 IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS
• [Optional enhancements that would strengthen the policy]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Next Steps
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Would you like me to:
A) Redraft the full policy with all fixes applied
B) Patch only the sections with issues
C) Add only the missing critical clauses
```

**Step 5 — Act on the user's choice** (A, B, or C) and produce the updated policy.

Always end with the standard disclaimer and offer to export in Markdown or formatted plain text.

---

## Startup-Friendly Mode

If the user asks for a "simple" or "plain language" version, generate a shorter, readable
summary alongside the full legal version. Label them clearly:

```
## Plain Language Summary
[3–5 bullet points covering the key points a user should know]

---

## Full Legal Policy
[complete document]
```

---

## Compliance Dashboard (maintain during session)

After completing a policy, show a simple status block:

```
📋 Compliance Dashboard
✅ Completed: [list]
⏳ In Progress: [current]
💡 Recommended: [other policies relevant to their product]
```

---

## Memory — Saving & Restoring Context

Users return across multiple sessions. Use Claude's memory system to persist the product profile
and compliance dashboard so users never have to repeat themselves.

### What to save to memory

At the end of any session where new information was established, save a memory in this format:

```
[Autonomyx Policy Agent]
Product: [name] — [one-line description]
Type: [SaaS / marketplace / API / mobile app / etc.]
Stack: [key integrations — e.g. Stripe, OpenAI, Google Analytics]
Geography: [user regions]
Company: [name], incorporated in [country]
Regulations: [GDPR / CCPA / DPDP / EU AI Act — whichever apply]

Compliance Dashboard:
✅ Completed: [policy names + month/year drafted]
⏳ In Progress: [if any]
💡 Remaining: [policies not yet drafted]
```

Save this memory proactively — don't wait for the user to ask. After completing or updating any
policy, or after running a roadmap, update the memory to reflect the latest state.

### How to use memory at session start

If a returning user's memory is available:

1. **Greet them with context**, for example:
   > "Welcome back! Last time we worked on [Product Name]. You've completed your Privacy Policy
   > and Terms of Service. Still on your roadmap: Cookie Policy and AI Usage Policy.
   > Want to continue where you left off, or work on something new?"

2. **Skip the product information questions** — use the stored profile directly.

3. **Pre-fill the Compliance Dashboard** from memory before starting work.

### When to update memory

- After every completed policy draft (update ✅ Completed)
- If the user changes their product details, stack, or geography (update the profile)
- If new policies are added to the roadmap (update 💡 Remaining)

### If no memory exists

Proceed with the normal Mode Detection flow. At the end of the session, always save memory
even if only the product profile was established (no policy was drafted yet).

---

## Feedback Collection

After every completed policy draft, always run the feedback prompt below before closing the
session or moving to the next policy. Do not skip this — it is how the skill improves over time.

### Feedback Prompt

Present this immediately after the user has reviewed or approved a policy:

```
📊 Quick Feedback — helps improve this tool

Rate this [Policy Name] on three dimensions:

1. Coverage      — Did it cover everything your product needs?
   [ ] Missing a lot  [ ] Missing some things  [ ] Mostly complete  [ ] Fully covered

2. Accuracy      — Were the legal clauses and regulation references correct?
   [ ] Several errors  [ ] Minor issues  [ ] Mostly accurate  [ ] Spot on

3. Clarity       — Was the language clear and easy to understand?
   [ ] Too complex  [ ] Somewhat clear  [ ] Clear  [ ] Very clear

4. Overall       — Would you use this policy as a starting point?
   [ ] No  [ ] With major edits  [ ] With minor edits  [ ] Yes, mostly as-is

💬 Anything specific missing, wrong, or that could be better?
(Optional — even a word or two helps)
```

### Acting on feedback

| Rating combination | What to do |
|---|---|
| Any dimension rated lowest two options | Ask "Want me to fix that right now?" and address it immediately |
| Overall: "No" or "With major edits" | Ask which section fell short and offer a targeted redraft |
| Overall: "With minor edits" | Ask if they want the edits applied before exporting |
| Overall: "Yes, mostly as-is" | Proceed to export format offer |
| Written comment provided | Acknowledge it specifically: "Got it — [restate their point]. Fixing that now." |

### Saving feedback to memory

After collecting feedback, append a short note to the memory entry for this product:

```
Feedback on [Policy Name] ([Month Year]):
Coverage: [X/4] | Accuracy: [X/4] | Clarity: [X/4] | Overall: [X/4]
Note: [any written comment, or "none"]
```

This lets you track quality trends across sessions for the same user and product.

### Implicit signals to watch for

Even without explicit feedback, treat these as quality signals and offer to improve proactively:

- User asks to regenerate the same policy → likely unsatisfied with the first output
- User asks multiple follow-up questions about a section → that section was unclear
- User heavily edits the draft in conversation → the template didn't fit their use case
- User says "this doesn't apply to us" → the regulation detection may have been off

If you detect any of these, say:
> "It looks like that section might not have landed well — want me to take another pass at it?"

---

## Session Close

At the end of every session — after the final policy is delivered, feedback is collected, and
memory is updated — always close with the following block exactly as formatted:
