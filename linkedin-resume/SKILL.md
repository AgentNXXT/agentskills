# Resume Generator — Any Profile, Any Platform

Creates a professional resume from any online profile, retrieved via platform-specific APIs
and Explorium prospect matching/enrichment.

## When to Use

Trigger this skill when the user:
- Asks to create/build/generate a resume from any online profile (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)
- Provides any profile URL and asks for a resume
- Provides a person's name (and optionally company) and asks for a resume
- Provides documents, chat exports, patents, or other content and asks for a resume
- Asks to convert any profile or professional data into resume format
- Asks to combine multiple sources into a resume

## Inputs

The user must provide **at least one** of the following:

**Identity sources (for prospect matching):**
- **Any profile URL** from a supported or unsupported platform
- **Full name + company name** (e.g., "John Doe at Acme Corp")
- **Email address** of the person
- **Multiple profile URLs** from different platforms (combined into one resume)

**Supplementary sources (for enriching the resume):**
- **Chat/message exports** — Slack archives, WhatsApp exports, Teams data, email `.mbox`/`.eml` files
- **Authored documents** — whitepapers, research papers, blog posts, presentations, proposals, PRDs
- **Patent numbers or inventor name** — for patent lookup
- **Blog or personal website URL** — for publication extraction
- **Certification URLs or badge links** — Credly, Google Cloud, AWS, Microsoft Learn
- **Screenshots** of profiles, dashboards, or achievement pages from any platform

The skill combines all provided sources into a single comprehensive resume. If the input
is ambiguous, ask the user to clarify before proceeding.

## Supported Platforms

### Tier 1 — Direct Prospect Match (richest data)
These platforms are natively supported by Explorium `match-prospects`:

| Platform | URL pattern | match-prospects field |
|---|---|---|
| **LinkedIn** | `linkedin.com/in/<username>` | `linkedin` (direct) |

### Tier 2 — Public API Resolution (portfolio + identity)
These platforms have public APIs to extract identity info and portfolio data:

| Platform | URL pattern | API endpoint | Resume section |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GitHub** | `github.com/<user>` | `api.github.com/users/<user>` | Technical Profile |
| **Docker Hub** | `hub.docker.com/u/<user>` | `hub.docker.com/v2/users/<user>` | Container & DevOps Profile |
| **WordPress.com** | `<site>.wordpress.com` or profile URL | WP MCP tools | Publishing & Content Profile |
| **npm** | `npmjs.com/~<user>` | `registry.npmjs.org/-/user/org.couchdb.user:<user>` | Open Source Packages |
| **PyPI** | `pypi.org/user/<user>` | `pypi.org/user/<user>` (web) | Open Source Packages |
| **Stack Overflow** | `stackoverflow.com/users/<id>/<name>` | `api.stackexchange.com/2.3/users/<id>` | Developer Community Profile |
| **Dev.to** | `dev.to/<user>` | `dev.to/api/users/by_username?url=<user>` | Technical Writing Profile |
| **Medium** | `medium.com/@<user>` | `medium.com/@<user>` (web) | Publishing & Content Profile |
| **Behance** | `behance.net/<user>` | `behance.net/<user>` (web) | Design Portfolio |
| **Dribbble** | `dribbble.com/<user>` | `dribbble.com/<user>` (web) | Design Portfolio |
| **Kaggle** | `kaggle.com/<user>` | `kaggle.com/<user>` (web) | Data Science Profile |

### Tier 3 — Chat & Messaging Platforms (skill inference from conversations)
These platforms don't expose public profile APIs, but if the user provides exported chat logs,
message archives, or grants access via MCP/API integrations, the skill can **infer professional
skills, expertise areas, and communication style** from conversation content.

| Platform | Input type | What can be inferred |
|---|---|---|
| **Slack** | Exported workspace data, channel archives, or MCP integration | Technical discussions, domain expertise, tools mentioned, leadership signals, collaboration patterns |
| **WhatsApp** | Exported chat `.txt` files | Professional discussions, industry knowledge, client interactions |
| **Microsoft Teams** | Exported chat/channel data | Technical expertise, project involvement, cross-functional skills |
| **Discord** | Exported server data or public server profiles | Community involvement, technical support, domain expertise |
| **Telegram** | Exported chat data | Professional discussions, technical knowledge |
| **Email (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)** | Exported `.mbox`, `.eml`, or `.pst` files, or user-provided email excerpts | Professional correspondence, client relationships, project coordination, industry terminology, role scope |

### Tier 3b — Documents Authored (skill inference from written work)
If the user provides documents they have authored, the skill can infer expertise, writing
ability, domain knowledge, and technical depth from the content.

| Document type | What can be inferred |
|---|---|
| **Technical documents** (whitepapers, RFCs, architecture docs) | Technical depth, system design skills, domain expertise |
| **Research papers / publications** | Academic expertise, research methodology, subject matter authority |
| **Blog posts / articles** | Communication skills, thought leadership, domain knowledge |
| **Presentations / slide decks** | Presentation skills, strategic thinking, audience awareness |
| **Reports / analyses** | Analytical skills, data interpretation, business acumen |
| **Code documentation / READMEs** | Technical writing, developer experience focus |
| **Proposals / RFPs** | Business development, solution architecture, client management |
| **Project plans / PRDs** | Project management, product thinking, requirements analysis |
| **Patents** | Innovation, technical invention, R&D leadership |

**Patent lookup:**
If the user provides their name or a patent number, search for patents via:
- Google Patents: `https://patents.google.com/?inventor=<name>` (WebFetch)
- USPTO: `https://patft.uspto.gov/` (WebFetch)
Extract: patent title, patent number, filing date, grant date, co-inventors, abstract.
Build a **Patents** section in the resume.

**Blog & publication lookup:**
If the user provides a blog URL or personal website, fetch the site via WebFetch and extract:
- Article titles, dates, and topics
- Recurring themes and expertise areas
- Authorship evidence

**How document inference works:**
1. Read the provided documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, or other supported formats)
2. Analyze content for:
   - **Subject matter expertise**: topics, technologies, methodologies discussed with authority
   - **Writing quality**: clarity, structure, persuasiveness (useful for summary tone)
   - **Technical depth**: complexity of concepts explained, tools and frameworks referenced
   - **Role indicators**: authorship context (individual contributor vs. lead vs. executive perspective)
   - **Publications list**: titles, dates, venues for a Publications section
3. Build a **Publications & Authored Work** section if formal publications are found
4. Merge inferred skills into the main Skills section (tagged as "inferred from authored work")

**Important:** Clearly distinguish between verified credentials (from platform APIs) and
inferred skills (from documents and chat). Use the label "(inferred)" next to skills
derived from unstructured content.

**How skill inference works:**
1. Parse the provided chat export or connected message source
2. Identify professional signals:
   - **Technical skills**: programming languages, tools, frameworks, platforms mentioned in context
   - **Domain expertise**: recurring topics, industry terminology, problem-solving patterns
   - **Soft skills**: leadership language ("I'll handle", "let's coordinate"), mentoring patterns,
     cross-team collaboration
   - **Projects & deliverables**: references to specific projects, launches, milestones
   - **Role indicators**: decision-making patterns, scope of responsibility
3. Build a **Communication & Collaboration Profile** section for the resume
4. Merge inferred skills into the main Skills section (tagged as "inferred from communications")

**Important:** Always inform the user that skills inferred from chat data are contextual
estimates, not verified credentials. Mark them distinctly in the resume.

### Tier 4 — Platforms Without Public APIs (context derivation)
For platforms that lack public APIs (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.),
the skill can still derive useful context from:

| Source | How to use |
|---|---|
| **User-provided activity exports** | Most platforms offer data export (Google Takeout, Microsoft account data, Amazon order history). If the user provides exported data files, parse them for professional signals. |
| **User-provided screenshots** | Read screenshots of profile pages, dashboards, certifications, or activity feeds using the image reading capability. Extract text, achievements, and activity data. |
| **User-described context** | Ask the user to describe their usage, certifications, or achievements on the platform. Incorporate their self-reported data (clearly marked as self-reported). |
| **Certification URLs** | Many platforms issue verifiable certifications (Google Cloud certs, AWS certs, Microsoft certs, Azure certs). If the user provides a certification verification URL, fetch and validate it. |
| **Public certification directories** | Some platforms have public cert verification pages (e.g., Credly badges, AWS Certification verification). If the user provides a badge URL, fetch it. |

**Certification platforms with public verification:**
- **Credly** (`credly.com/users/<user>`) — badges from AWS, Google, Microsoft, Cisco, etc.
- **Acclaim/Credly badges** — direct badge URLs are publicly fetchable
- **Google Cloud Skills Boost** (`cloudskillsboost.google/public_profiles/<id>`)
- **Microsoft Learn** (`learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/<user>`)
- **AWS Certification** (verification requires cert number from user)

### Tier 5 — Web Fetch Fallback (any other platform)
Any other platform URL not covered above. The skill fetches the public page and attempts
to extract:
- Display name
- Bio / about text
- Company or organization
- Email (if publicly visible)
- Portfolio items or activity
- Certification badges or achievements

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Resolve External Profiles

For each non-LinkedIn URL provided, resolve it to identity information and portfolio data.

#### GitHub (`github.com/<username>`)
1. Fetch `https://api.github.com/users/<username>` via WebFetch
2. Extract: `name`, `email`, `company`, `bio`, `public_repos`, `followers`, `blog`
3. Fetch `https://api.github.com/users/<username>/repos?sort=stars&per_page=5` for top repos
4. Fetch `https://api.github.com/users/<username>/events/public` for recent activity & languages
5. Store as **GitHub Portfolio** data

#### Docker Hub (`hub.docker.com/u/<username>`)
1. Fetch `https://hub.docker.com/v2/users/<username>` via WebFetch
2. Fetch `https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/<username>/?page_size=5&ordering=-star_count`
   for top images
3. Extract: username, full name (if available), top images with pull counts and stars
4. Store as **Docker Portfolio** data

#### WordPress.com (site URL or profile)
1. Use the WordPress MCP tools (`wpcom-mcp-user-profile`, `wpcom-mcp-user-sites`) if the user
   is authenticated, OR fetch the public site via WebFetch
2. Extract: display name, site URL, site description, recent posts, content themes
3. Store as **WordPress Portfolio** data

#### Stack Overflow (`stackoverflow.com/users/<id>/<name>`)
1. Extract user ID from URL
2. Fetch `https://api.stackexchange.com/2.3/users/<id>?site=stackoverflow` via WebFetch
3. Extract: `display_name`, `reputation`, `badge_counts`, `about_me`, `website_url`, `location`
4. Fetch `https://api.stackexchange.com/2.3/users/<id>/top-tags?site=stackoverflow&pagesize=10`
   for expertise areas
5. Store as **Stack Overflow Profile** data

#### npm (`npmjs.com/~<username>`)
1. Fetch `https://registry.npmjs.org/-/v1/search?text=maintainer:<username>&size=10` via WebFetch
2. Extract: package names, descriptions, download counts
3. Store as **npm Portfolio** data

#### PyPI (`pypi.org/user/<username>`)
1. Fetch `https://pypi.org/user/<username>/` via WebFetch
2. Extract: list of maintained packages
3. For top packages, fetch `https://pypi.org/pypi/<package>/json` for details
4. Store as **PyPI Portfolio** data

#### Dev.to (`dev.to/<username>`)
1. Fetch `https://dev.to/api/users/by_username?url=<username>` via WebFetch
2. Extract: `name`, `username`, `summary`, `github_username`, `website_url`, `joined_at`
3. Fetch `https://dev.to/api/articles?username=<username>&per_page=5` for top articles
4. Store as **Dev.to Portfolio** data

#### Medium, Behance, Dribbble, Kaggle, or any other platform
1. Fetch the public profile page via WebFetch
2. Parse the page content to extract: display name, bio, location, portfolio items,
   follower counts, or any other publicly visible information
3. Store as **[Platform] Portfolio** data

**Identity resolution priority (for prospect matching):**
After resolving all profiles, combine extracted identifiers in this priority:
1. `email` (most reliable for matching)
2. `full_name` + `company_name` (good for matching)
3. `full_name` alone (may produce multiple matches — will require user disambiguation)

If no identifiers can be extracted from any provided profile, inform the user and ask for
a LinkedIn URL, email, or full name + company.

### Step 1 — Match the Prospect

Use `match-prospects` to identify the person in Explorium's database.

**Input mapping:**
| User provides | match-prospects field |
|---|---|
| LinkedIn URL | `linkedin` (direct) |
| Other platform URL | Resolved via Step 0 → `full_name` + `company_name` and/or `email` |
| Full name + company | `full_name` + `company_name` |
| Email address | `email` |

**Matching strategy for non-LinkedIn inputs:**
- Try the most specific identifiers first (email > name+company > name alone)
- If `match-prospects` returns no results with name+company, retry with email if available
- If multiple matches are returned, present them to the user and ask which person to use

**If no match is found:**
- If portfolio data was collected in Step 0, offer to generate a **portfolio-only resume**
  using just the platform data (no Explorium enrichment). This resume will have portfolio
  sections but limited work history.
- Otherwise, inform the user and suggest they provide a LinkedIn URL or additional identifiers.

### Step 2 — Enrich the Prospect Profile

Once matched, call `enrich-prospects` with:
- `enrichments`: `["enrich-prospects-profiles"]`
- The `session_id` and `table_name` from the match-prospects result

This retrieves:
- Full name and demographics
- Current and past job titles, companies, and durations
- Education history (schools, degrees, fields of study)
- Location information
- Role details and seniority

### Step 3 — Optionally Enrich Contact Information

If the user explicitly requests contact details on the resume, also call `enrich-prospects` with:
- `enrichments`: `["enrich-prospects-contacts"]`
- `parameters`: `{"contact_types": ["email", "phone"]}` (or whichever the user requests)

**Important:** Only include contact information if the user specifically asks for it. Contact
enrichment has a credit cost — always show the cost estimate and get user confirmation before
proceeding.

### Step 4 — Generate the Resume

Using all retrieved data (Explorium enrichment + platform portfolio data), generate a
professional resume following the format in the **Resume Template** section below.

**Data mapping rules:**
- **Name**: Use the full name from the enriched profile (Explorium takes priority over platform data)
- **Title**: Use the current job title; if unavailable, derive from most recent role
- **Location**: Use city/state/country from the profile
- **Contact**: Only include if Step 3 was performed and user requested it
- **Profile Links**: Include all platform URLs the user provided in the header
- **Summary**: Synthesize a 2–3 sentence professional summary from role history, seniority,
  industry, and skills. If platform portfolio data is available, weave in relevant highlights
  (e.g., "active open-source contributor with 50+ GitHub repos"). Do NOT fabricate achievements
  or metrics not present in the data.
- **Experience**: List all roles in reverse chronological order. Include company name, title,
  date range, and location where available.
- **Education**: List degrees in reverse chronological order. Include institution, degree,
  field of study, and dates where available.
- **Skills**: Extract from job titles, role descriptions, industry context, AND platform data
  (GitHub languages, Stack Overflow top tags, npm/PyPI package domains). Only include skills
  with clear evidence.
- **Platform Portfolio Sections**: Append platform-specific sections after Skills. Only include
  sections for platforms where data was collected. See template below.

### Step 4b — Prompt for Additional Sources

Before generating the final resume, **proactively ask the user** if they can provide
additional sources to strengthen the resume. Present a checklist of potential sources
based on what's missing:

> **To build the strongest possible resume, consider sharing any of these additional sources:**
>
> **Profile URLs** (the more, the better):
> - [ ] LinkedIn profile
> - [ ] GitHub profile
> - [ ] Stack Overflow profile
> - [ ] Docker Hub profile
> - [ ] npm / PyPI author page
> - [ ] Dev.to / Medium / blog URL
> - [ ] Behance / Dribbble portfolio
> - [ ] Kaggle profile
> - [ ] Personal website or blog
> - [ ] Any other professional profile
>
> **Documents & work samples:**
> - [ ] Published papers, whitepapers, or articles
> - [ ] Patent numbers (or name for patent search)
> - [ ] Presentations or slide decks
> - [ ] Technical documentation you've authored
>
> **Communications (for skill inference):**
> - [ ] Slack workspace export
> - [ ] Email archives (`.mbox` or sample emails)
> - [ ] Chat exports (WhatsApp, Teams, Discord)
>
> **Certifications:**
> - [ ] Credly badge URLs
> - [ ] Cloud certification links (AWS, GCP, Azure)
> - [ ] Any certification verification URLs
>
> **Other:**
> - [ ] Screenshots of profiles or achievements
> - [ ] Activity exports from any platform (Google Takeout, etc.)
>
> *You can skip any of these — I'll build the best resume possible with whatever you provide.
> Just say "go ahead" to proceed with what we have, or share additional sources.*

Only show items that haven't already been provided. Skip the prompt entirely if the user
has explicitly said they want a quick/simple resume or to proceed with what they have.

### Step 5 — Present and Refine

- Present the resume to the user in Markdown format
- Offer to adjust formatting, add/remove sections, or regenerate with different emphasis
- If the user wants to export, offer to save as a Markdown file

**Note:** Only include the platform-specific sections for which data was actually collected.
Omit all others entirely.

---

## Important Rules

1. **Never fabricate data.** If a field is not available from the enrichment or platform API,
   omit it entirely. Do not guess job responsibilities, achievements, metrics, or skills that
   are not supported by the retrieved data.

2. **Respect credit costs.** Profile enrichment and contact enrichment consume credits. Always
   show the cost estimate to the user and wait for confirmation before running enrichments.

3. **Privacy awareness.** Resumes contain personal information. Remind the user that the
   generated resume is based on publicly available profile data and should be used responsibly
   and in compliance with applicable privacy regulations.

4. **Date formatting.** Use "MMM YYYY" format (e.g., "Jan 2020") for dates. If only a year
   is available, use the year alone. If no dates are available for a role, use "Dates not
   available."

5. **Presentation order.** Always present sections in this order: Header, Summary, Experience,
   Education, Skills, Platform Portfolios (GitHub, Docker, SO, npm/PyPI, Dev.to/Medium,
   Behance/Dribbble, WordPress, Kaggle), Publications & Authored Work, Communication &
   Collaboration Profile, Patents, Certifications. If a section has no data, omit it entirely
   rather than showing an empty section.

6. **Multiple profiles.** If the user provides multiple platform URLs for the **same person**,
   combine all portfolio data into a single resume. If the user asks for resumes for
   **different people**, process them sequentially and confirm each enrichment cost separately.

7. **Multiple platform URLs.** When the user provides URLs from several platforms:
   - Use the LinkedIn URL (if present) as the primary identifier for `match-prospects`
   - Use other platform URLs for portfolio sections
   - Cross-reference names across platforms to confirm they belong to the same person
   - If names don't match across platforms, alert the user before proceeding

8. **Refinement.** After presenting the resume, proactively offer:
   - Adjusting the professional summary tone (e.g., more technical, more executive)
   - Reordering or emphasizing certain roles or portfolio sections
   - Adding a specific skills section focus
   - Removing platform sections the user doesn't want
   - Saving the resume to a file

9. **Unsupported platforms.** If the user provides a URL from a platform not listed in
   Tier 2, attempt a Tier 3 (WebFetch) resolution. If the page is not publicly accessible
   or returns no useful data, inform the user and suggest alternative platforms.

---

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|---|---|
| No match found (with portfolio data) | Offer portfolio-only resume; suggest LinkedIn URL for full resume |
| No match found (no portfolio data) | Ask user to verify input; suggest LinkedIn URL, email, or name+company |
| Multiple matches | Present options with name, title, and company; ask user to pick |
| Enrichment returns sparse data | Generate resume with available data; note which sections are incomplete |
| Enrichment cost too high | Show cost estimate; suggest matching only (free) for basic info |
| URL is malformed | Ask user to verify the URL format |
| Platform API rate limited | Inform user; skip that platform's portfolio section; proceed with others |
| Platform page not publicly accessible | Inform user; suggest alternative profile URL or platform |
| Profile has no name or email | Ask user for additional identifiers (LinkedIn, email, name) |
| Names don't match across platforms | Alert user; ask to confirm the profiles belong to the same person |
