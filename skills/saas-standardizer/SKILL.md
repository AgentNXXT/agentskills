name: saas-standardizer
description: >
  Produces exhaustive, standardized profiles of SaaS products across 18 dimensions for procurement and comparison decisions. Trigger whenever a user wants to evaluate, profile, research, or compare any SaaS product — even if they don't say "evaluate". Trigger on: "tell me about [product]", "compare [A] vs [B]", "why choose X over Y", "what's the G2 rating", "who backs [product]", "is X open source", "how fast is [company] growing", "what do Reddit users say about X", "how is [product] priced", "is [product] SOC 2 certified", "what support does [product] offer", "what's on [product]'s roadmap". Covers: Features, Use Cases (role-specific), Login Methods, APIs, Data Ingestion, Integrations, Pricing, Security & Compliance, Support & SLA, Roadmap & Vision, Competitive Positioning, Analyst Rankings (G2/Gartner), Open Source Health (GitHub/Docker), Funding & Backing, Notable Clients, Growth Signals, Customer References, and Community Sentiment. Always be exhaustive.

# SaaS Standardizer

Produces exhaustive, standardized profiles of SaaS products across 23 fixed dimensions. Every dimension must be covered completely — leave no sub-point blank. If information is unavailable, state it explicitly rather than skipping.

---

## Skill Configuration

Set these values before use. Claude reads them at the start of every session:

| Key | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `WEBHOOK_URL` | Endpoint to POST reports to after user confirms | `https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/abc/xyz/` |
| `WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Optional HMAC-SHA256 signing secret for request verification | `my-secret-token` |

**To configure:** Edit the lines below and replace the placeholder values.

```
WEBHOOK_URL=        # ← paste your endpoint here
WEBHOOK_SECRET=     # ← paste your secret here (optional, leave blank to skip signing)
```

Supported portal types (any webhook-compatible endpoint works):
- Zapier Webhooks / Make (Integromat) scenarios
- Airtable automations
- Notion API via middleware
- Custom REST APIs
- Slack incoming webhooks
- n8n, Pipedream, or any HTTP trigger

---

## Input Sources

Accept information from any combination of:
- **Web research** — search product website, docs, changelog, pricing page, security page, API reference
- **URL** — fetch the provided URL and follow links to docs, pricing, integrations pages
- **Uploaded file** — PDF, doc, or other file with product info
- **User notes** — pasted text, bullet points, or freeform description
- **User-provided research** — analyst reports, internal evaluations, vendor responses, RFP answers, demo notes, or any credible third-party source the user shares

When the user provides a URL or file, prioritize that. Use web search to fill every gap. Always list all sources used at the top of the profile.

---

## User-Provided Research: Integration Protocol

When a user shares their own research — a document, pasted findings, analyst report, vendor questionnaire response, pricing quote, demo notes, internal eval, or any cited third-party source — treat it as a **first-class input**, not a supplement.

### Credibility Assessment

Before integrating, briefly assess the source:

| Source type | Credibility treatment |
|---|---|
| Vendor-provided (datasheet, sales deck, RFP response) | Include but label as vendor-claimed — cross-check independently where possible |
| Independent analyst (Gartner, Forrester, IDC, G2, Capterra) | High trust — prioritise over web search findings |
| User's own internal eval / demo notes | High trust for experiential claims (UX, support quality, sales process) — label as first-hand observation |
| Press / tech media (TechCrunch, InfoQ, The Register, etc.) | Medium trust — include with source and date |
| Community / Reddit / forums | Medium trust — useful for sentiment, flag as anecdotal |
| Unattributed or unclear origin | Include with a caveat: *"Source credibility unverified — treat as unconfirmed"* |

### How to integrate

1. **Do not discard or override user research** — even if it conflicts with what web search returns
2. **Merge it into the relevant dimension(s)** — place findings where they belong in the report structure, not in a separate "user said" block
3. **Where user research conflicts with other sources**, surface the conflict explicitly:
   > *"User-provided research (Gartner report, 2025) states X. Vendor's website currently states Y. The discrepancy may reflect a recent product change — recommend confirming with vendor."*
4. **Where user research fills a gap** that web search couldn't answer, mark it clearly:
   > *"Per user-provided RFP response (dated [date]): [finding]"*
5. **Where user research is more recent or more specific** than anything found via web search, treat it as the authoritative source for that point
6. **Always cite user-provided research** in the Sources list at the top of the report, with as much detail as available (document title, author, date, origin)

### Improving the knowledge base

If the user's research reveals something materially new — a pricing structure not published anywhere, a security certification not listed on the vendor's site, a known bug or limitation from hands-on use — acknowledge it explicitly:

> "This is a valuable detail not surfaced in public sources. I've incorporated it into the report under [Dimension X] and flagged it as first-hand / analyst-verified."

Never flatten user-provided findings into generic phrasing. Keep the specificity — if they share exact numbers, quotes, or test results, reproduce them accurately with attribution.

## Output Modes

| Situation | Output Mode |
|---|---|
| Single product, first mention | **Full Profile** |
| Single product, specific question | **Dimension Spotlight** |
| Two or more products | **Side-by-Side Comparison** |
| User says "evaluate" or "assess" | **Full Profile** |
| User says "compare" or "vs" | **Side-by-Side Comparison** |
| User asks about one dimension | **Dimension Spotlight** |

## The 18 Standard Dimensions — Exhaustive Coverage Required

Every bullet point below must be addressed in the output. If unknown, write: *"Not publicly documented — confirm with vendor."*

---

### Feature Registry Protocol

The **Master Feature Registry** lives at `references/feature-registry.md` in this skill.
It is the canonical, living list of expected features per software category, maintained
across all Autonomyx skills.

**Before profiling Dimension 1 (Features) for any product:**
1. Use the Notion MCP to query the Features database filtered by the product's category
   (see Notion Backend — Data Source IDs above for the collection URLs)
2. Find all features matching the product's software category
3. Use the category's feature list as your **checklist** — assess the product against every
   feature listed, rather than discovering features freeform
4. This ensures consistent, comparable coverage across all profiles

**Feature existence rule — strictly enforced:**
A feature may only be recorded as present (any status other than ❌ Not Present or
❓ Roadmap Unknown) if confirmed by ONE of these two sources:
- **Official documentation** — docs site, feature pages, API reference, changelog, release notes
- **GitHub repository** — README, CHANGELOG, release tags, closed issues confirming shipment

Analyst reports, G2, Capterra, Gartner Peer Insights, and press releases may inform how
*well* a feature works (used for Differentiators and scoring depth) but cannot alone confirm
a feature exists. If a feature is widely discussed in reviews but not found in docs or GitHub,
record it as ❓ Roadmap Unknown and note the review signal separately.

**After completing Dimension 1:**
- Review the features you found and confirmed via docs/GitHub
- Identify any features NOT yet listed in the registry for this category
- For each new feature confirmed by docs or GitHub, use the Notion MCP to create a
  page in the Features database with: Feature Name, Description, Section, Category relation,
  Source URL, Discovered In, and Added date
- If the category doesn't exist in Notion yet, create it in the Categories database first
- Confirm to the user: "I found [N] new feature(s) not previously in the master registry
  and have added them: [list]. The registry has been updated."
- If no new features were found, note: "All features found are already in the master registry."

This keeps the registry growing over time — every product profiled makes future profiles
more thorough.

### Notion Backend — Registry Location

## Notion Backend — Persistent Storage

The Master Feature Registry is stored in Notion. Use the Notion MCP tools to read and write.

### Reading features for a category

```
1. Query Categories to find the category page URL by name
2. Query Features filtered by Category = <category page URL>
   → returns all features for that category with Section, Description, Source
```

### Writing a new feature discovery

```
Create a page in Features with:
  "Feature Name": <name>
  "Description": <desc>
  "Section": <one of the 10 section options>
  "Category": [<category page URL>]
  "Source": <docs or GitHub URL>
  "Discovered In": <app name>
  "Added": <YYYY-MM-DD>
```

### Writing a feature status (gap analysis result)

```
Create a page in Feature Status with:
  "Name": "<App Name> — <Feature Name>"
  "App": [<app page URL>]
  "Feature": [<feature page URL>]
  "Status": <GA | Beta | Early Access | Feature Flag | Upcoming (Official) | Upcoming (Signal) | Not Present | Roadmap Unknown>
  "Evidence Source": <docs or GitHub URL>
  "Notes": <analyst quote, roadmap ETA, or review excerpt>
  "Last Verified": <YYYY-MM-DD>
```

### Adding a new app

```
Create a page in Apps with:
  "App Name": <name>
  "Category": [<category page URL>]
  "Docs URL": <official docs URL>
  "GitHub URL": <public GitHub repo URL>
  "Gartner URL": <Gartner Peer Insights page URL>
  "Last Analysed": <YYYY-MM-DD>
```

### 15. Pricing & Total Cost of Ownership

> ⚙️ **Delegated to `saas-cost-analyzer` skill — do NOT calculate pricing yourself.**

This dimension is fully handled by the `saas-cost-analyzer` skill. Follow these steps exactly:

**Step 1 — Collect inputs before delegating**

Before invoking the cost analyzer, gather the following from the user (or infer from context if already provided):
- Number of users / seats
- Expected usage (API calls, storage, transactions, environments — as relevant)
- Contract duration preference (monthly / annual / multi-year)
- Expected growth rate over contract period
- Any governance or compliance constraints (HIPAA, GDPR, FedRAMP, SOC 2, etc.)
- Whether they are an AWS or GCP customer (for marketplace pricing)
- Any known negotiated discounts or existing quotes

If any required inputs are missing, **ask the user before proceeding** — do not guess or assume values silently.

**Step 2 — Invoke the saas-cost-analyzer skill**

Read `/mnt/skills/user/saas-cost-analyzer/SKILL.md` and follow its full methodology for the product(s) being profiled. Pass all inputs collected in Step 1.

The cost analyzer will produce:
- Cost Breakdown Table (per tool)
- Scenario Comparison Table (Small / Medium / Large scale)
- Hidden Cost & Risk Summary
- Assumptions Log
- Executive Summary
- Final Recommendation & Order of Preference (for comparisons)
- Marketplace pricing check (AWS + GCP)
- Open source / self-hosting cost model (if applicable)

**Step 3 — Embed the output**

Place the full saas-cost-analyzer output under this dimension heading in the report. Do not summarise or truncate it — include everything the cost analyzer produces.

**Step 4 — Cross-link to other dimensions**

After the pricing output, add a brief cross-reference note if relevant findings elsewhere in the report affect cost interpretation. For example:
- "See Dim 21 (Vendor Risk) — high lock-in risk increases effective switching cost"
- "See Dim 17 (Support & SLA) — enterprise support tier adds ~$X/month not included above"
- "See Dim 22 (Implementation) — professional services cost estimated at $X-$Y"

**What NOT to do:**
- Do not estimate, approximate, or calculate any pricing figures yourself
- Do not skip this dimension because pricing is not publicly listed — the cost analyzer handles opaque pricing by using competitor benchmarks and review data
- Do not produce a simplified price table as a substitute for the full cost analyzer output

## Handling Uncertainty

- If any sub-point can't be verified via web search: *"Not publicly documented — confirm with vendor."*
- Never fabricate specific values (rate limits, file size caps, named integrations). Mark estimates as *"likely"* or *"unconfirmed"*.
- For niche or new products, flag limited coverage upfront and note which sections need vendor verification.
- Do not skip or collapse sub-points due to lack of info — absence of info is itself informative.
- **If user-provided research resolves a gap** — use it and mark it as resolved: *"Confirmed via [source]"* rather than leaving it as unverified.
- **If user-provided research conflicts with public sources** — surface the conflict, state both data points, and recommend the user verify with the vendor rather than picking one silently.
- **Never downgrade user-provided first-hand findings** (e.g. demo experience, internal test results) just because they aren't publicly corroborated — label them clearly and include them.

---

## Behavior Notes

- **Be exhaustive without exception.** Every sub-point in every dimension must be addressed.
- **Never summarize away detail.** More specifics are always better than vaguer summaries.
- **Always include the full Evaluator's Summary** on Full Profiles.
- **On comparison requests**, ask "Full profiles for each, or just the table?" if unclear.
- **When info is from user notes**, acknowledge gaps and research further to fill them.
- **For dimensions 7–23** (all non-core dims), always use web search to pull live data — these change frequently and should never rely on training knowledge alone.
- **Section 13 (Open Source Health)** should be skipped with a note if the product is fully proprietary with no public repo.
- **Section 15 (Pricing)** — always delegated to the `saas-cost-analyzer` skill. Read `/mnt/skills/user/saas-cost-analyzer/SKILL.md` and follow its full methodology. Never calculate pricing yourself.
- **Section 19 (AI & ML)** — always research current AI features; this changes monthly for most products.
- **Section 21 (Vendor Risk)** — pay special attention to open-source license history and any recent acquisitions.
- **For growth signals**, clearly distinguish between disclosed figures and analyst estimates. Label estimates as *(estimated)*.
- **For community sentiment**, synthesize tone — don't just list sources. Give an actionable read: e.g., "Developers love the API flexibility but consistently flag poor documentation as a blocker."
- **For comparison articles**, prefer independent sources over vendor-sponsored content. Always note when a source has a commercial relationship with the product.

---

## Webhook: Report Submission

After every Full Profile or Side-by-Side Comparison is delivered, Claude must follow this confirmation and submission flow.

### Step 1 — Ask for Consent

Once the report is fully displayed, always ask for explicit informed consent before doing anything with the webhook. Show this message word-for-word:

> "Before I submit this report to your external portal, I want to let you know what will be sent:
>
> - The **full research report** (all dimensions, all findings)
> - The **Evaluator's Summary** (conclusions, recommendations, risk ratings)
> - **Product name**, report type, and dimensions covered
> - **All sources and URLs** used during research
> - A **timestamp** of when this report was generated
>
> This data will be sent via POST request to the configured webhook endpoint. It will not be shared with any other party.
>
> Do you consent to submitting this report? Reply **yes** to submit, or **no** to skip."

**Consent rules — strictly enforced:**
- Never fire the webhook without this explicit consent step, even if the user previously said "always submit" or "auto-submit"
- Consent is per-report — ask fresh every time, even in the same conversation
- Only the words "yes", "submit", "send it", "go ahead", "confirm", or clear equivalents count as consent
- If the user says "maybe", "later", or is ambiguous — treat it as **no** and skip
- If the user says "no" or "skip" — acknowledge and move on without submitting
- Never guilt, nudge, or re-ask after a "no"
- Never describe what will be sent in vague terms — always show the full list above so consent is genuinely informed

---

### Step 2 — Read Config

Before submitting, retrieve the webhook settings from this skill's config:

- `WEBHOOK_URL` — the endpoint to POST to
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET` — optional secret for request signing

If `WEBHOOK_URL` is empty or missing, tell the user:

> "No webhook URL is configured. To enable report submission, open the skill's SKILL.md and set `WEBHOOK_URL` in the config block at the top of the file."

Do not attempt to fire the webhook and do not ask the user to provide a URL inline.

---

### Step 3 — Build the Payload

Construct a JSON payload with the following structure:

```json
{
  "event": "saas_report_generated",
  "timestamp": "<ISO 8601 UTC timestamp>",
  "product": "<product name(s) profiled>",
  "report_type": "<full_profile | comparison | dimension_spotlight>",
  "dimensions_covered": ["<list of dimension names included>"],
  "summary": {
    "strength": "<from Evaluator's Summary>",
    "watch_out": "<from Evaluator's Summary>",
    "best_for": "<from Evaluator's Summary>",
    "avoid_if": "<from Evaluator's Summary>",
    "market_position": "<from Evaluator's Summary>",
    "momentum": "<from Evaluator's Summary>",
    "security_posture": "<from Evaluator's Summary>",
    "vendor_risk": "<from Evaluator's Summary>",
    "ai_readiness": "<from Evaluator's Summary>"
  },
  "full_report": "<the complete report text as a single string, preserving all sections>",
  "sources": ["<list of all URLs and sources used>"],
  "user_confirmed": true
}
```

**Rules:**
- `full_report` must contain the entire generated report — all dimensions, all sub-points — not a truncated version
- `dimensions_covered` lists only dimensions that were actually researched and included
- `sources` lists every URL fetched or search result cited during research
- All string values must be properly JSON-escaped

---

### Step 4 — Sign the Request (if WEBHOOK_SECRET is set)

If `WEBHOOK_SECRET` is non-empty, generate an HMAC-SHA256 signature:

```
signature = HMAC-SHA256(key=WEBHOOK_SECRET, message=<raw JSON payload string>)
```

Include it as a request header:
```
X-Webhook-Signature: sha256=<hex digest>
```

If `WEBHOOK_SECRET` is empty, omit the signature header entirely.

---

### Step 5 — POST the Payload

Send the payload to `WEBHOOK_URL`:

```
POST <WEBHOOK_URL>
Content-Type: application/json
X-Webhook-Signature: sha256=<hex digest>   (only if secret is set)

<JSON payload>
```

**Use `bash_tool` with curl** to fire the request:

```bash
curl -s -o /tmp/webhook_response.txt -w "%{http_code}" \
  -X POST "<WEBHOOK_URL>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Webhook-Signature: sha256=<signature>" \  # omit if no secret
  -d '<escaped JSON payload>'
```

Capture both the HTTP status code and response body.

---

### Step 6 — Report Back to User

**On success (HTTP 2xx):**
> "✅ Report submitted successfully to your portal."

**On client error (HTTP 4xx):**
> "⚠️ Submission failed — the portal returned [status code]. This usually means the webhook URL is incorrect or the request format was rejected. Check your WEBHOOK_URL config and portal settings."

**On server error (HTTP 5xx):**
> "⚠️ Submission failed — the portal returned a server error ([status code]). The endpoint may be temporarily unavailable. You can try again by saying 'resubmit'."

**On network/connection error:**
> "⚠️ Could not reach the webhook URL. Check that the URL is correct and the endpoint is reachable."

Never expose the full raw response body to the user unless they ask for debug info.

---

### Step 7 — Check In & Human Handoff

After Step 6 (whether submission succeeded, failed, or was skipped), always close with this message:

> "Is there anything else you'd like to dig into — a specific dimension, a competitor comparison, or a deeper cost breakdown?
>
> If you'd like to speak with a specialist — for vendor negotiation, implementation planning, or a bespoke procurement review — I can connect you with a human expert. Just say **'connect me'** and I'll arrange it."

**Handling follow-up responses:**

- If the user asks another question → answer it, then repeat the handoff offer at the end
- If the user says **"connect me"**, **"speak to someone"**, **"talk to a human"**, **"get help"**, or similar:
  > "I'll flag this for a human specialist now. Please share:
  > 1. Your name and organisation (optional but helpful)
  > 2. What you need help with (e.g. vendor negotiation, implementation, compliance review)
  > 3. Preferred contact method and timezone
  >
  > Someone will be in touch shortly."
  
  Then fire a separate **handoff webhook event** to `WEBHOOK_URL` with this payload:
  ```json
  {
    "event": "human_handoff_requested",
    "timestamp": "<ISO 8601 UTC>",
    "product": "<product(s) from the report>",
    "report_type": "<full_profile | comparison | dimension_spotlight>",
    "user_context": {
      "name": "<if provided>",
      "organisation": "<if provided>",
      "help_needed": "<what they described>",
      "contact_preference": "<if provided>",
      "timezone": "<if provided>"
    },
    "conversation_summary": "<2-3 sentence summary of what was researched and any key concerns raised>"
  }
  ```
  
  This handoff webhook fires **without requiring consent** — the user has explicitly requested human contact, which constitutes consent for this specific event.

- If the user says **"no"**, **"I'm done"**, **"that's all"** → respond warmly and close:
  > "Got it — good luck with your evaluation. Feel free to come back anytime."
  
  Do not re-ask or linger.

---

### Resubmit Command

If the user says "resubmit", "try again", or "resend", re-fire the same payload without rebuilding the report. Confirm with:
> "Resubmitting the last report to your portal..."

Then follow Steps 4–6 again.

---

### Privacy Note

The full report payload may contain commercially sensitive research. Always confirm before submitting:
- Never auto-submit without explicit user approval
- Never send to any URL other than the configured `WEBHOOK_URL`
- Never log or expose `WEBHOOK_SECRET` in any response to the user
